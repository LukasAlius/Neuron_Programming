## Introduction

NEURON is an extensible nerve modelling and simulation program. It allows you to create complex nerve models by connecting multiple one-dimensional sections together to form arbitrary neuron morphologies, and allows you to insert multiple membrane properties into these sections (including channels, synapses, and ionic concentrations). The interface was designed to present the neural modeller with an intuitive environment and hide the details of the numerical methods used in the simulation.

## Summary

### Part A

In part A we start with the basics: how to create a single compartment neuron model with Hodgkin-Huxley conductances, how to run the simulator and how to display the simulation results.

### Part B

In part B we move into the more advanced topics of building multi-compartmental neurons and using different types of graphs to display the results.

### Part C
 In part C we will replicate neurons using templates and connect these neurons together.

### Part D
 In part D we will add new membrane mechanisms to the simulator and incorporate them in our neurons.

### Part E
 Finally, in part E we will look at ways of saving data from the simulations and methods for increasing simulation speed.

## Target

Model a small network of rat subthalamic nucleus neurons.
